# About Me 

<img src="data/me-cropped.jpg" width="300">

I am a sixth year graduate student in the MIT AeroAstro department, 
hoping to graduate in February 2022. 
My current research focuses on methods for tractable global optimization 
using machine learning and mixed integer convex optimization. 

I am particularly interested in practical implementations of optimization
in engineering design. In my previous work, I have used 
[geometric
 programming](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gp101.html)
and its non-log-convex extension [signomial 
programming](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/signomialprogramming.html) to tackle
conceptual engineering design problems. I have also implemented 
[robust optimization (RO) in engineering
design](https://robust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
and explored how RO improves engineering design decisions under uncertainty. 

As I finish my PhD, I am finalizing a global optimization method that can accommodate arbitrary 
nonconvex, black box and data driven constraints over a bounded variable domain. 
The method will be submitted to *Operations Research* for review in early October. 
As such, much of my research occurs at the intersection of optimization, machine learning and engineering. 

I was a member of the now defunct [Convex Engineering Group](https://convex.mit.edu/), 
a group of students interested in leveraging convexity to improve
the design process. During a typical work week I live and work
with my colleagues in the [Aerospace Computational Design Lab](http://acdl-web.mit.edu/), 
and I am advised by Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas, Prof. Mark Drela, and Principal Research Engineer Robert Haimes.
