# About Me 

<img src="data/me-cropped.jpg" width="300">

I am a fourth year graduate student in the MIT AeroAstro department. 
My current research focuses on methods for tractable global optimization 
using machine learning and mixed integer convex optimization. 

I am particularly interested in practical implementations of global optimization
in engineering design. 
In my previous work, I have used 
[geometric
 programming](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gp101.html)
and its non-log-convex extension [signomial 
programming](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/signomialprogramming.html) to tackle
conceptual engineering design problems. I have also implemented 
[robust optimization (RO) in engineering
design](https://robust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
and explored how RO improves engineering design decisions under uncertainty. 

Now I seek to generalize 
these methods to accommodate challenging non-signomial and black
box constraints. As such, much of my research occurs at the intersection of optimization, 
machine learning and engineering. 

I am a member of the [Convex Engineering Group](https://convex.mit.edu/), 
a group of students interested in leveraging convexity to improve
the design process. During a typical work week I live and work
with my colleagues in the [Aerospace Computational Design Lab](http://acdl-web.mit.edu/), 
and I am advised by Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas, Prof. Mark Drela, and Principal Research Engineer Robert Haimes.
