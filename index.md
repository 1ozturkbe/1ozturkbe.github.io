# About Me 

<img src="data/me-cropped.jpg" width="300">

I am a researcher working at the intersection of engineering, optimization and machine learning. I obtained my PhD in aerospace engineering from MIT in January 2022, working on 
methods for [global and robust optimization methods for engineering design]({{site.url}}/data/ozturk-bozturk-PhD-AeroAstro-2022-thesis.pdf). A majority of my work is open source and available [here]({{site.url}}/research). 
Starting in May 2022, I will be applying my skills at MITRE in the Decision Analytics Group, where I hope to have an impact in the public sector. 

In my Master's and PhD work, I was particularly motivated by the potential of optimization
in improving the engineering design process. 
I used [geometric programming](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gp101.html)
and its non-log-convex extension [signomial programming](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/signomialprogramming.html) to tackle
conceptual engineering design problems. I implemented [robust optimization (RO) in engineering design](https://robust.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
and explored how RO improves engineering design decisions under uncertainty. 
Later in my PhD, I used machine learning methods to enable [global optimization](https://github.com/1ozturkbe/OCTHaGOn.jl) over arbitrary nonconvex, black box and data driven constraints. I was advised by Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas, Prof. Mark Drela, and Principal Research Engineer Robert Haimes.
