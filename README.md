# About Me

<img src="data/me-cropped.jpg" width="300">

I am a sixth year graduate student in the MIT AeroAstro department. 
My current research focuses on methods for enabling engineering design
using tractable global optimization. 
Much of my research occurs at the intersection of optimization, 
machine learning and engineering.
