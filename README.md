# About Me

<img src="data/me-cropped.jpg" width="300">

I am a researcher working at the intersection of engineering, optimization and machine learning. I obtained my PhD in aerospace engineering from MIT in January 2022, working on 
methods for [global and robust optimization methods for engineering design]({{site.url}}/data/ozturk-bozturk-PhD-AeroAstro-2022-thesis.pdf). A majority of my work is open source and available [here]({{site.url}}/research). 
Starting in May 2022, I will be applying my skills at MITRE in the Decision Analytics Group, where I hope to have an impact in the public sector.
