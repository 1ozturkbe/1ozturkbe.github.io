# Research

Here I will periodically post research progress updates. 

## Software 

I believe strongly in open source software. You can follow
my and my collaborators' research in real time through the following repositories:

- [robust](https://github.com/convexengineering/robust) and 
[its documentation](http://robust.readthedocs.org/), for engineering
design under under uncertainty using geometric and signomial programming.
- [OptimalConstraintTree](https://github.com/1ozturkbe/OptimalConstraintTree),
for optimization compatible constraints from black boxes or data.
- [GPkit](https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit) 
and [its documentation](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for
an intuitive Python package for engineering design leveraging convexity
and object-oriented programming. 

If you are interested in the above tools, I also recommend visiting the following resources:

- [sageopt](https://github.com/rileyjmurray/sageopt) and
[its documentation](https://rileyjmurray.github.io/sageopt/), for global optimization
of signomials and polynomials.
