## Software 

I believe strongly in open source software. You can follow
me and my collaborators' research in real time through the following repositories:

- [OCTHaGOn.jl](https://github.com/1ozturkbe/OCTHaGOn.jl),
for global optimization over arbitrary explicit and inexplicit constraints via optimal decision trees,
- [OptimalTrees.jl](https://github.com/1ozturkbe/OptimalTrees.jl),
for mixed-integer optimization methods for decision tree learning, 
- [15094code](https://github.com/1ozturkbe/15094code), 
for demonstrations of robust optimization methods applied to different
problems in operations research, 
- [GPkit](https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit) 
and [its documentation](https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), for
a Python package for engineering design leveraging convexity
and object-oriented programming, 
- [robust](https://github.com/convexengineering/robust) and 
[its documentation](http://robust.readthedocs.org/), for engineering
design under under uncertainty using geometric and signomial programming,
- [SPaircraft](https://github.com/convexengineering/SPaircraft) and
[its documentation](https://spaircraft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
for a conceptual commercial aircraft model based on TASOPT, the largest open-source signomial programming compatible engineering model thus far. 

If you are interested in the above tools, I also recommend visiting the following resources:

- [sageopt](https://github.com/rileyjmurray/sageopt) and
[its documentation](https://rileyjmurray.github.io/sageopt/), for global optimization
of signomials and polynomials.
- [convexengineering](https://github.com/convexengineering), 
to find other repositories and resources using 
geometric programming in design. 
- [Interpretable AI](https://www.interpretable.ai/),
for interpretable machine learning methods, available under an academic license.
