The last few months I have spent working on my thesis proposal and in lockdown due to the 
Covid-19 epidemic have gotten me to reflect more deeply about the synergies between engineering
design and robust optimization (RO). I hope to create a repository of these ideas here, 
hopefully more clearly motivating robust optimization in the context of engineering

But firstly...

### Why optimization under uncertainty? 

If you are here, I assume that you think that optimization under uncertainty is inherently
good, but if you are not convinced, consider a single linear constraint, \( y \geq x \)

We want designs that are _robust to realizations of uncertainty in the real world_.
