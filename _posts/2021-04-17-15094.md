It has been hectic this Spring semester balancing research, TAing and life outside of graduate school, 
not to mention the Covid-induced stresses. 

In the meanwhile however, I have enjoyed TAing Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas's Robust Optimization (RO) course (15.094), 
a course I had taken four years ago. It is great to digest the theoretical material again through teaching, and 
pass on my experience applying the methods to real problems.

On this note, I have been in charge of the practical components of the recitations and problem sets. 
I had found in the past that there was not enough emphasis on practical applications of the methods, 
which (in my opinion) is required for a firm grasp of RO. 

At my Github repository [15094code](https://github.com/1ozturkbe/15094code), I have created a small portfolio of 
RO models formulated using Julia's JuMP optimization software. 
There are applications from multi-commodity flow to optimal experimental design. 
I am hoping to eventually turn the repository into a set of demos showing how RO is a tractable and practical method for optimization under uncertainty, 
and hopefully it will be of some educational and practical use to some folks!
