After the submission of my paper with Dimitris titled *Global Optimization via Optimal Decision Trees*, I am releasing the implementation of the method in the repository [here](https://github.com/1ozturkbe/OCTHaGOn.jl). Right now, it is implemented for Julia 1.5 and requires an installation of [Interpretable AI](https://www.interpretable.ai/), available for free under an academic license. 

 The code is a work in progress, and documentation is pending. I encourage you to consult the *test* and *data/baron* folders in the repository to see implementations to specific global optimization instances. Please feel free to post issues if you are having problems and encounter bugs.
