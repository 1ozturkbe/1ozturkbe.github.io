I have defended my thesis proposal titled **Global Optimization in Engineering Design via Geometric Programming**.
My committee members are Prof. Mark Drela, Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas and Principal Research Engineer
Robert Haimes. I hope to update the website with some of my accomplishments and future
work soon! But here is the abstract:

*There is a need to adapt and improve conceptual design methods
through better optimization, to address the challenge of
designing future engineered systems. Aerospace design problems
are tightly-coupled multidisciplinary optimization (MDO) problems, and require
all-at-once solutions methods for design consensus and global optimality.
Although the literature on MDO has been growing, there are few tractable methods
for simultaneous optimization in the aerospace field.
I propose signomial programming (SP) as a tractable and practical way to
formulate all-at-once engineering design optimization problems. SP extends geometric
programming, which is a log-convex optimization formulation that can be solved efficiently
using interior point methods. SP has been proposed
for global solutions of large-scale aerospace problems
such as transonic aircraft design, but has several shortcomings
that it shares with other MDO formulations.
Designs through SP are sensitive to uncertainty in parameters, and
no tractable methods yet exist to solve optimization problems under uncertainty with
probabilistic guarantees of constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, since signomial
programs require explicit, SP-compatible constraints,
they are restricted in their ability to accommodate data and/or black box functions.
In this thesis, I enable conceptual engineering design under uncertainty by developing a robust SP
framework for optimization over uncertain parameters. I leverage
optimal regression trees to be able to generate SP-compatible constraints
over arbitrary data and/or functions.
I use the combination of SP-compatible constraints and constraint approximations
to develop a global SP framework for engineering design.
The proposed methods will solve engineering design problems efficiently
and deterministically, and keep practical concerns for conceptual design
in focus.*
